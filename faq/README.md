1.	**Where are the files?** 
The files are found by clicking the links found in the text

2.	**How long can the entire process take?** 
Approximately two hours, with the corresponding previous training in the programming language R.

3.	**The information of the files is arranged one below the other in a spreadsheet?** Yes, the elaborated code identifies the variables of interest, ordering the information in columns.

4.	**The code also detects the terms compatible with cancer diagnoses and creates a database with only these diagnoses?** 
Yes, it creates a database that only has diagnoses compatible with cancer. It has not failed to detect any diagnosis of cancer during the tests performed.

5.	**The automatic reports take into account the topography of the tumors and order them according to frequency?** 
Yes, it performs an automatic report with tables and graphs according to the most frequent tumor locations and also disaggregates the data according to sex.

6.	**What difference was found in the reports with respect to those made from the registration in Canreg?** 
No differences were observed in the number of cancer cases detected and there were only 3% of cases not included in the corresponding topographical category, but in the category "other tumor locations". 

Therefore, this is an effective methodology to detect cancer cases from a set of *Microsoft Word* or *PDF* files and provide institutions with a quick and useful statistical report.
